# PY101-109 Small Problems, Easy 3, Problem 9. "Clean up the words":

"""Given a string that consists of some words and an assortment of 
non-alphabetic characters, write a function that returns that string 
with all of the non-alphabetic characters replaced by spaces. If one or 
more non-alphabetic characters occur in a row, you should only have one 
space in the result (i.e., the result string should never have 
consecutive spaces).

Example:
print(clean_up("---what's my +*& line?") == " what s my line ")
# True
"""
